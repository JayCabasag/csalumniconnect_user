## Installation

To run this project locally, you need to have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JayCabasag/csalumniconnect_user.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd csalumniconnect_user
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

The application will be running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Configuration

The application requires configuration for authentication and database connectivity. You need to provide the necessary configuration values in a `.env` file in the project root directory. Create a `.env` file and add the following variables:

```
REACT_APP_API_BASE_URL=YOUR_API_BASE_URL
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
```

Replace `YOUR_API_BASE_URL` with the base URL of your backend API (if applicable). For authentication, you need to set up a Firebase project and obtain the API key, auth domain, and project ID. Replace `YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY`, `YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`, and `YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID` with your Firebase configuration values.

## Deployment

To deploy the application to a production environment, you can use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory. You can then deploy the contents of this directory to a static hosting service or a server of your choice.
